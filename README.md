# 3DSEPSO
This repository contains 3DSEPSO, PSO and GA algorithm for emergency communication deployment. Due to confidentiality reasons, the original DSM data of the paper is not provided. To ensure that the algorithm can run directly after downloading, we provide mock data "DSM_mock. tif" and "building_mock. tif". Running SEPSO, PSO, or GA directly in Matlab R2022a yields results
